My name is Guilherme Ventura, I am 28 years old, 10 of which working with programming. I am graduated in Computer Science, working for [SPREAD GmbH][2], solving problems with JavaScript.

I also have some experience with C#, SQL/T-SQL and Java (focused on Android). I am always studying other languages and frameworks, like Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

<h3>Blog</h3>

My idea with the blog is to share my day to day experiences, and to exercise my writing skills. I am always active on [Twitter][1], sharing stuff that are of my interest. Sometimes may appear posts by myself, take a look!

<h3>A Little Story About Me</h3>

My entrance into the development career was kind of accidental. I was always the "computer boy", always fascinated by these incredible machines, but I had no idea about the programming world. The closes I've come to a script was in RPG Maker, with [<abbr title="Ruby Game Scripting System">RGSS</abbr>][3]. Besides that, I've gone to far from Paint.

I started working when I was 16, as an office boy (actually, an under age apprentice) in a manufacturing company. In one of my wanderings through the company, I met the development section, responsible of developing and maintaining part of the production controlling software. That was when I discovered we can **program computers!** ðŸ˜®

Since that day, still in high school, I started studying Java by my own. In the comings and goings from work, I talked to the development guys with some doubts and progresses, until the day I was hired as an intern in the .Net team.

And that's how my development career started, in February 2012, and since then I have this as a profession and hobby.
